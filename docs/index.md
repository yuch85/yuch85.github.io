title: A Linux for legaltech
---

# Vision

Our mission is to build a shared, open, and community-driven foundation for the future of legal technology — a “Linux for legaltech.” We aim to unite lawyers, engineers, researchers, and builders around a common infrastructure layer that empowers everyone, especially small and mid-sized firms who lack access to expensive proprietary tools. This project is not driven by profit; it is driven by the belief that legal AI should be transparent, extensible, and accessible to all, with a core that stays open as a public commons.

# Contract Playbook AI

One component of this broader mission is **Contract Playbook AI**, detailed in  
**[ContractAI.md](ContractAI.md)** — just a single building block within the larger ecosystem we are creating together.
