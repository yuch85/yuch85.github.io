## 🚀 Key Features

- **Playbook Generation** – Extract negotiation rules, risk positions, and preferred clauses from existing contracts.  
- **Automated Contract Review** – Identify risks (Red/Yellow/Green) against a defined playbook.  
- **Interactive Redlining** – Apply AI-suggested changes directly in a rich-text editor.  
- **Microsoft Word Compatibility** – Parse `.docx` in-browser and export with formatting preserved.

## 🌟 Vision

This project is an experimental frontend proof-of-concept. The real goal: build an **open-source library that enables programmatic, full-document editing and diff in `.docx`**, laying the foundation for enterprise-grade contract automation and AI-assisted workflows. Contributions that improve the current system or help explore this deeper docx engine are highly welcome.
