Exploring Word document automation. Current prototype uses Superdoc for clause extraction and structured editing. Long-term goal: to build an open-source library enabling deterministic, whole-document .docx edits with OfficeJS and headless edits. Seeking collaborators who care about diffing, docx internals, and enterprise-grade workflows.
